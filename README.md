### ðŸ”§.FILES ###

This is a snapshot of my dot files. Please note, whilst there is an `install.sh` script , it's really intended for my own use.

##### That said: #####

You are welcome to have a look around and use whatever you like, or:

Just run this script to get everything setup
```
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ferdipret/vimconfig/master/install.sh`"
```

*This will work providing you don't already have an existing symlink to your .vimrc*
